<p class="tb">Each year more students undertake science fair projects,
many of which involve some aspect of nuclear science or
technology.</p>
<p>The United States Atomic Energy Commission has prepared
this booklet to help these young exhibitors, their science
teachers, project counselors, and parents.</p>
<p>The booklet suggests also some of the numerous nuclear
topics on which students can base meaningful science projects.
It offers all exhibitors&mdash;regardless of age, experience,
or project topic&mdash;advice on how to plan, design, and
construct successful exhibits. It describes some rewards
awaiting those who win their way to the National Science
Fair-International, including 10 AEC Special Awards offered
for the most outstanding nuclear exhibits.</p>
<p>Detailed advice on conducting science projects is omitted,
partly because several earlier publications deal with the
subject, but also because much of the personal satisfaction
gained while doing a science project stems from the student
investigator&rsquo;s opportunity to exercise his initiative, imagination,
and judgment in solving a problem of his own choice,
in his own way.</p>
<p>We trust this booklet will encourage students to enter science
fair competition, and hope it will help their advisers
guide them toward better projects and more successful exhibits.</p>

<p class="pcap">Interviews help AEC Special Awards
judges identify the most outstanding
nuclear-related exhibits entered in each
National Science Fair-International.
Here, Elizabeth Winstead of Jacksonville,
Florida, explains her irradiated
fruit flies to Dr. Paul W. McDaniel, AEC
Director of Research and a Special
Awards judge at the 1963 national fair,
Albuquerque, New Mexico. Selected as
one of the 10 winners, Miss Winstead
and her science teacher spent a week at
the Commission&rsquo;s Argonne National

<p><span class="ss">ROBERT G. LeCOMPTE</span> majored in English (A. B., St. Benedict&rsquo;s,
1935) and has worked primarily as a communicator&mdash;reporter,
house-organ editor and photographer, military-information officer
and instructor, public-relations consultant, and information and
exhibits specialist. He joined the Atomic Energy Commission&rsquo;s
staff at Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1951, transferring in 1957 to
the AEC&rsquo;s Headquarters, where he is Exhibits and Education Officer
in the Division of Technical Information. His concern with
science stems from aviation writing, World War II service as an
Air Force pilot and technical-intelligence officer, science-news
reporting, and requirements for presenting AEC scientific-technical
developments to the lay public. He has been involved in
science fair activities since 1960, when he began the study which
led to establishment of AEC Special Awards for outstanding nuclear-related
exhibits at the National Science Fair-International.</p>

at Furman University, Dr. Wood organized a statewide science fair
program in South Carolina. He moved to the New Mexico Institute
of Mining and Technology in 1957, and expanded that state&rsquo;s program
by organizing four regional science fairs. He joined the staff
of Science Service in 1960 and edited <i>Chemistry</i> magazine and

<h1 title=""><span class="small"><span class="ss">Atoms at the Science Fair

<p class="center small"><span class="ssn">by ROBERT G. LeCOMPTE and BURRELL L. WOOD</span></p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">SCIENCE PROJECTS, EXHIBITS, AND FAIRS</span></h2>
<p>In almost every area of endeavor, we learn best by
<i>doing</i>. Books and lectures provide background, but it is
by putting theory into practice that we make knowledge
truly our own. To learn a language, we read and speak
it. Our knowledge of mathematics follows practice at
problem solving, and so it is with science.</p>
<h3 id="c2">Science Projects</h3>
<p>In conducting a good science project, we work in much
the same manner as professional scientists. Like them,
we observe, experiment, investigate, speculate, and check
the validity of our speculations with more experiments, all
in order to learn something. If our work is good, others
may learn from it too, but only if we present it adequately.</p>
<p>Better understanding of an area of science is the least
that we can gain from doing a science project. At their
best, science projects foster habits of effective planning,
attention to detail, careful work, and high performance
standards that will serve us well throughout our lives.
Moreover, there is always the promise that the project
will open the door to a satisfying career.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h3 id="c3">Project Exhibits</h3>
<p>More and more, scientists are called upon to share their
work not only with other scientists but also with legislators,
administrators, sociologists, artists&mdash;all kinds of people
in all kinds of professions. To follow this lead, student
scientists also must tell other people about their science
projects.</p>
<p>When executed properly, exhibits are an effective way to
do this. Exhibits which combine interesting visual materials
with well-written messages can communicate much
in very limited time and space. Good exhibits can speak
clearly to a great variety of viewers. Those already generally
familiar with the subject may absorb the entire
message, but even the uninitiated will find something of
interest.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Science Fairs</h3>
<p>Fairs have been popular throughout history. Generally
they have been occasions to display work or feats of which
people are proud. Often they have stimulated progress and
the exchange of goods and ideas.</p>
<p>Early in this century some teachers encouraged their
students to undertake individual science projects, then exhibit
them before their classmates and fellow students.
Between the two World Wars some individual school systems
developed citywide science fairs to show the most
outstanding of these exhibits from each school. The science
fair movement gained momentum rapidly after World
War II, and in 1950 the First National Science Fair was
held in Philadelphia, drawing exhibitors from 13 affiliated
area fairs.</p>
<p>Today the national event draws exhibitors from more
than 200 affiliated state and regional fairs. Recent entry
of competitors from several other countries has produced
its new title&mdash;National Science Fair-International (NSFI).
It is the &ldquo;Olympic Games&rdquo; for science fair exhibitors,
conducted by Science Clubs of America, an activity of
Science Service, 1719 N Street N. W., Washington, D. C.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="591" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The growing international flavor of the national science fair is exemplified
in contestants like Anders S. Brahme, Sweden&rsquo;s entrant
at Albuquerque in 1963, and the first non-U. S. student to achieve
Atomic Energy Commission Special Awards recognition. He was
one of 10 alternates to the 10 winners and is shown receiving a
Certificate of Achievement from Harry S. Traynor, AEC Assistant
General Manager.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Usually state and regional science fairs are limited,
like the national event, to the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades,
but occasionally they have a division for junior high school
entrants. In school districts where junior high schools hold
fairs, the district fair frequently includes both senior high
and junior high divisions. Some elementary schools conduct
science fairs for their 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students. In
both the elementary and junior high school divisions, exhibitors
usually compete against entrants of their own
grade level, for example, 5th graders against 5th graders,
and 9th graders against 9th graders. In the senior division
each entrant competes against all others. Although the
overall quality of exhibits at local fairs is rarely up to
that of regional, state, and national fairs, the local events
are possibly the most valuable educational tools because
they are viewed by so large a &ldquo;grass-roots&rdquo; audience of
classmates, parents, teachers, and other local citizens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>In science fairs&mdash;as in athletics or music&mdash;top prizes
are seldom won by first-time competitors. Almost all
national fair exhibitors have participated in science fairs
at various levels for a year or more before winning their
way into the national event. Both experience in science
projects and practice in display techniques are required
to develop outstanding exhibits. Since this is true, the time
to start the science project which will form the basis for
your exhibit is now!</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">YOUR SCIENCE PROJECT</span></h2>
<h3 id="c6">Choosing the Topic</h3>
<p>Since you will necessarily spend considerable thought,
time, physical effort, and (sometimes) money on your
project, pick a topic from which you can expect to learn
something. If you can avoid the temptation to pick one with
which you are already familiar, you will probably get more
out of it. Your project should be an adventure, not merely
a drill!</p>
<p>On the other hand your science project need not be in
utterly unexplored areas; to be successful you need not
come up with data and conclusions which will confound
professional scientists who have spent their lives in similar
work. You are a student and a hobbyist, not yet a professional
research scientist. Primarily your project should
advance your personal knowledge, and your abilities to
observe, speculate, hypothesize, experiment, deduce, and
conclude.</p>
<p>You should choose a project which you can expect to
follow to a successful conclusion, but which is enough
above your current knowledge to make you &ldquo;stretch&rdquo;
your abilities.</p>
<p>But it is important not to bite off more than you can
chew. The project should not demand so much time that
you neglect other responsibilities. However, you need not
pass up an interesting topic because covering all of it
would consume too much time. Instead, zero in on just
those aspects which interest you most.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>You may be able to select a project which will be of
continuing interest in later years. For example, a 9th-grade
general-science student might begin by making an
<i>overall survey</i> of a topic to discover what is already known
about it and what remains to be discovered. As a 10th-grade
biology student, he might investigate <i>biological</i> aspects
of his topic, and then follow with investigations of
<i>chemical</i> and <i>physical</i> aspects of it while studying 11th
grade chemistry and 12th grade physics. Some outstanding
science fair exhibits have resulted from such progressive
development of a single project which the exhibitors undertook
first in junior high school.</p>
<p>Whenever you ask a question about some aspect of nature
you have a possible project topic. &ldquo;How does a chicken
hatch?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is the best way to treat a burn?&rdquo; &ldquo;How
could nuclear energy be used in space travel?&rdquo; You need
only examine the questions that occur to you every day
to find dozens of topics on which to base projects.</p>
<p>You might identify promising topics by reviewing the
table of contents in your science text, noting chapters
or topics of particular interest. Or you may find it helpful
to consult the references listed in the appendix to this
booklet. If you are interested in a project related to atomic
energy, the appendix lists also many nuclear topics and
research areas.</p>
<p>It is probably wise to select several potential project
topics, do a little reading on each of them, and then pick
one. Before reaching a decision, discuss them with your
teachers and parents. Your science teacher can help you
pick a topic that will relate closely to classroom work,
and may be able to suggest interesting approaches you
haven&rsquo;t considered. By talking your project topic over with
your parents and advisers you can make sure that you will
have the time, working space, moral support, and financial
resources needed to complete it successfully.</p>

<p>At the outset, the exhibit possibilities of your chosen
project may not be clearly apparent. You cannot predict
exactly what procedures you will follow nor what conclusions
you will draw. As you proceed, you will probably
uncover many facts which you will want to tell people
about. If you choose a good topic, work carefully and accurately,
and cover the topic fully, you will produce a
successful project which can form the basis for a good
exhibit.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Where to Get Help</h3>
<p>One mark of a truly educated individual is his willingness
to discuss his problems with others and profit by
their advice and help. One of the most important things that
you can learn while doing a project is how and where to
obtain information and assistance.</p>
<p>Your <i>science teacher</i> may be an excellent source. If he
cannot provide specialized help himself probably he can
direct you to those who can.</p>
<p>Your <i>school librarian</i> can point out specialized references
such as scientific encyclopedias and &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; reference
books. Scientific magazines and journals have good &ldquo;survey
articles&rdquo; on recent developments. Don&rsquo;t overlook the public,
college, and special technical libraries near you. Also,
academies of science, technical societies, and science
laboratories may have libraries or publications you can
use.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that your topic is one on which some
expert local counseling will be available&mdash;from your science
teacher or one of your parents, your family physician
or the local pharmacist, your agricultural extension agent,
or scientific and engineering personnel of a nearby manufacturing
plant, defense installation, research laboratory,
or college.</p>
<p>Select a <i>project adviser</i> and try to enlist his cooperation.
Explain your choice of topic to him and how you plan to
develop it. (If you have already done background reading
you may find him more receptive and more helpful.) You
may need to consult him on several different occasions.
You will probably want him to check you project plan to
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
make sure that you have not left out an important step, or
included some potential pitfall. Also, you may want him to
review the final written report in which you summarize
your work and findings.</p>
<p>However, your project must rest upon work done by you.
It is permissible to obtain assistance from others, but
never to the extent that you are standing on the sidelines
watching someone else do your work. Keep your interviews
brief and approach each conference with a clear idea of
what you are seeking and why, and always only after you
have already done as much as possible&mdash;whether by way
of reading or project work&mdash;to find the answer on your
own. By doing this you will gain valuable habits of self-reliance,
and added stature in your adviser&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p><i>Special equipment and materials</i> may be obtained or borrowed
through laboratories. College laboratories assist
sometimes. Some industrial organizations may have surplus
equipment and materials that they are willing to lend or
donate.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Documenting Your Work</h3>
<p><b>Project Notebook</b> Every scientist worth his salt keeps
detailed notes on each project on which he works. You
should do likewise. This notebook, which could as well be
a set of file cards, contains a running, day-by-day account
of everything that concerns the project&mdash;observations,
speculations, experiments, materials, expenses, procedures,
data and observations, hypotheses, checks for
validity, conclusions, and conjectures. From such notebooks
comes the information for the scientist&rsquo;s formal
report, or &ldquo;paper&rdquo;, by which he advises his employers and
colleagues of the progress of his work.</p>
<p>Since the notebook contains everything pertaining to your
project, it may become disarranged, no matter how well
you organize it in the beginning. If so, don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;just
keep it up to date.</p>
<p><b>Project Report</b> But there should be nothing haphazard
about the final report on your project. In some science
fairs, this report is displayed in the exhibit and considered
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
in the judging. Even where not required, the project
report belongs with your exhibit.</p>
<p>After writing your report you will find that much of your
exhibit planning&mdash;and even some of the text which will
appear in your exhibit&mdash;is already accomplished.</p>
<p>If you are doing your project as a classroom assignment,
your teacher may specify the manner in which your report
is to be organized. Otherwise, you can follow a format such as this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="ss">1.</span> TITLE. Keep it short. If accuracy requires more than a
few words, consider using a very brief main title and a more
definitive subtitle.</p>
<p><span class="ss">2.</span> ABSTRACT. This is a very brief condensation of the entire
report summarizing the objectives of the project, what you
did, and the conclusions you came to.</p>
<p><span class="ss">3.</span> INTRODUCTION. Describe your topic and give some
background information such as relevant work done by others.
Summarize your purpose, scope, and method of investigation.
State the questions or hypotheses your examined. Include the
most significant findings of your investigations.</p>
<p><span class="ss">4.</span> MATERIALS AND METHODS. Describe in detail the materials,
equipment, methods, experiments, controls, unforeseen
difficulties and remedies.</p>
<p><span class="ss">5.</span> OBSERVATIONS AND DATA. Describe your observations.
Include some of your observational data here as an example.
You may wish to put the bulk of it in an appendix.</p>
<p><span class="ss">6.</span> DISCUSSION OF RESULTS. Give the main conclusions
your observations tend to prove or deny. (Disproval of your
initial hypothesis may be as important as proof of it!) Include
the evidence developed for each main conclusion and any exceptions,
or for opposing theories. Offer possible explanations.
Compare your results and interpretations with those of other
workers in the same field.</p>
<p><span class="ss">7.</span> NEW QUESTIONS, POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS, AND FUTURE
PROJECTS, IF ANY.</p>
<p><span class="ss">8.</span> APPENDIX. Give more detailed and supplementary information,
often including graphs, tables, photographs, and
drawings.</p>
<p><span class="ss">9.</span> BIBLIOGRAPHY. Keep it brief, listing only those books
and periodicals which you actually used to provide background
information.</p>
<p><span class="ss">10.</span> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. Both prudence and the best
traditions of science require that you acknowledge all help
which you receive. Usually student scientists do not produce
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
laboratory work of professional quality, nor do student exhibitors
match the skill of commercial designers and fabricators.
Consequently, when judges encounter very exceptional unacknowledged
work, they may reasonably wonder if the exhibitor
received some professional help. And if on part, they speculate,
on how much more? Result: they might be tempted to
disqualify the exhibit entirely, whereas if you had acknowledged
frankly&mdash;&ldquo;Professor James Smith, Alpha University, for loan
of four color transparencies&rdquo;, or &ldquo;My father, who devised the
lighting system&rdquo;&mdash;you might lose a point or two on their
scorecards, but remain in competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your project notebook and your formal project report
are important components of your exhibit to follow. If both
are completed first, you will find planning the rest of your
exhibit a much simpler task.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">EXHIBITING YOUR SCIENCE PROJECT</span></h2>
<h3 id="c10">Planning the Content of Your Exhibit</h3>
<p>Try to organize your exhibit content so that it will be
meaningful to viewers who know less about it than you do.
The following outline may be followed, but is not the only
one possible. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to let the unusual aspects of
your project influence the organization of its exhibit.</p>
<p><b>Title</b> The same title you chose for your project report
may be an acceptable exhibit title. It should be brief and as
nontechnical as possible. A subtitle may explain or amplify
the main title.</p>
<p><b>The Summary Message (or Statement of the Problem)</b>
Give the viewer a capsule explanation of the project and its
significance. You may use a simplified version of your
abstract, eliminating information and language which is not
meaningful to the average viewer. Keep it simple.</p>
<p><b>Hypotheses and Conclusions</b> List these briefly in a manner
understandable to the average viewer. (Those interested
in details can find them in your notebook and project report.)</p>
<p><b>Method and Scope of Investigation</b> Hit only the high
points, but emphasize instances where you feel you displayed
unusual imagination, ingenuity, or resourcefulness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p><b>Observations and Data</b> Both are important, but in an
exhibit too many data can be dull. Select only those which
are essential to the capsule story of your project.</p>
<p><b>Photographs and Illustrations</b> Review the foregoing elements
to see where pictures will tell your story as well as
(or better than) words. List all photographs you have already
taken of your project, ones you can still obtain, and
drawings which will illustrate or help narrate your story.
Don&rsquo;t be selective yet. Later, when you are designing your
exhibit layout, space limitations will force you to choose.</p>
<p><b>Equipment and Specimens</b> These also help narrate your
story. Select objects and apparatus which will provide
viewers a good grasp of your project work. Have you hit
upon a low-cost substitute for expensive laboratory equipment?
Do some of your specimens present clearly visible
evidence of points you want to make? Are any of the experimental
results or specimens particularly unusual, spectacular,
or beautiful? List them for possible use.</p>
<p><b>Handout Brochure</b> An important but frequently overlooked
exhibit component is the &ldquo;handout brochure&rdquo; to be
distributed to interested viewers. Even a single mimeographed
page can supply more written information than
should be displayed in the limited space of the exhibit. It
can provide serious viewers a condensed version of the
project report. The brochure provides all viewers a reference
when they discuss the science fair and your exhibit
with others. Consider the handout brochure while planning
your exhibit&rsquo;s contents because it can contain data and
graphs which might otherwise clutter and confuse your
exhibit proper.</p>
<h3 id="c11">How Exhibits Are Judged</h3>
<p>Rules for the judging of exhibits vary, but most science
fairs stick fairly closely to the criteria and point values
used by the National Science Fair-International, which are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><span class="lj">I. Creative Ability </span>Total 30 points</p>
<p>How much of the work appears to show originality of approach
or handling? Judge that which appears to you to be
original regardless of the expense of purchased or borrowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
equipment. Give weight to ingenious uses of materials, if
present. Consider collections creative if they seem to serve a
purpose.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Such rules leave much to the individual discretion of the
judges, particularly regarding the distinction between the
science project itself and the exhibit. Be sure to study your
local rules and judging criteria carefully. Since usually 60
points pertain to creativity and sound scientific thought, a
large part of your score depends on the original excellence
of your science project. The remaining 40 points apply to
the manner in which you develop your exhibit of that project.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>AEC Special Award competition
is judged by a &ldquo;blue-ribbon&rdquo;
panel composed of people who
head research and development
programs at AEC
offices and laboratories
throughout the United
States. At the 14th NSFI
at Albuquerque, these
judges spent the morning identifying
eligible exhibits, &ldquo;huddled&rdquo;
late in the afternoon to
select semifinal choices, and
then in the evening talked
with each semifinalist before
making the final
choice of winners and

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Judges study criteria and point values before evaluating
exhibits. Although your exhibit should speak for itself, at
many fairs the judges chat with each exhibitor to determine
how well he understands his project area. Be prepared to
present details concisely and clearly, but avoid lengthy
explanations unless asked.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Designing Your Exhibit</h3>
<p>After you have finished your project, documented your
work in a project report, planned and listed what must go
into the exhibit, and familiarized yourself with the ground
rules under which you will compete, you are ready to design
your exhibit. The sections which follow suggest guidelines
and construction hints on exhibit structure; ways of
presenting information (text, photographs, transparencies,
line drawings, captions, models, specimens, laboratory
equipment, etc.); layout and location of exhibit items, exhibit
materials, color, and lighting.</p>
<h4>STRUCTURE</h4>
<p><i>Size.</i> National Science Fair-International rules limit
exhibit size to 48 inches wide and 30 inches deep. The
structure may rest on the floor, on its own supports, or on
a table (normally about 30 inches high) supplied by the fair.
Even if local rules permit more space, you may find it
desirable to build to NSFI rules so your structure will be
eligible at all fairs.</p>
<p>The overall height of your exhibit is limited by practical
considerations to about 7 feet, since the passing viewer&rsquo;s
eye encompasses most easily the area between 30 and 90
inches above the floor and the view of someone standing near
is even more limited. Tabletop structures 48 inches or
less in height work out nicely, and can conserve materials.</p>
<p><i>Shape.</i> With few exceptions, science fair exhibitors can
explain their projects adequately within structures similar
to those shown in Figures <a href="#fig10">1</a> and <a href="#fig11">2</a>. Such tabletop &ldquo;booth&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
exhibits have these common features: (a) a large back wall
which can be used for the introductory message, for
featured illustrations or specimens, or for important
conclusions; (b) two smaller side walls, angled outward
for easier viewing, which can contain supplementary text
and illustrations; and (c) horizontal display space at table
height to hold specimens, apparatus, project notebook and
project report, handout brochures, etc. Some exhibitors fit
this space with a slanted- or stepped-shelf unit. If the back
and side walls are fastened to such a base the structure
is stronger.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<p class="pcap"><i>These two basic structures are designed for simplicity, flexibility,
economy of materials, and repeated use in successive years of
science fair competition. Both meet NSFI rules on maximum dimensions.
The structure shown in Figure 1 is easiest to build. The
one in Figure 2 is a modified Figure 1 designed to accommodate an
outsize object which must rest on the floor.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig10">

<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 2</span></p>
</div>
<p>Many variations are possible. Very tall objects might be
handled by the self-supporting structure shown in <a href="#fig11">Figure 2</a>.
Some exhibitors extend back and side walls to the floor,
but this requires more panel material and tempts the
exhibitor to mount text and illustrations below the level
of easy viewing.</p>
<p>The title board can be functional as well as attractive,
as in <a href="#fig10">Figure 1</a>. It puts your main title where it can be seen
easily and it conserves wall space. It can brace the side
walls and serve to shield lights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p><i>Materials.</i> Attractive exhibit structures can be built
from artboard and similar paper products, so for one-time-only
elementary school exhibits you may not wish to
invest in more permanent materials. But if you look forward
to other projects, exhibits, and fairs, you will be wise to
consider materials which will hold up in repeated use.
Even though most fairs do not permit you to compete in
successive years with the same exhibit material, seldom
do they require you to build a new structure each year to
hold your changing displays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masonite&rdquo; and similar wood-fiber particle boards are
relatively inexpensive, take paint and adhesives well, are
fairly light, and in thicknesses of more than &#8539; inch and
lengths of less than 48 inches are sufficiently rigid when
supported by adjoining panels. They are available with
rows of holes pre-drilled to accommodate a multiplicity
of &ldquo;pegboard&rdquo; hanger devices. If you hope to use your
basic structure for other exhibits, pegboard allows you
flexibility in rearranging three-dimensional exhibit items.
Also, the holes facilitate wiring down display items that
might be dislodged by careless viewers or filched by
thoughtless souvenir hunters.</p>
<p>One standard 4-by-8 foot sheet of hardboard or plywood
will suffice for the typical tabletop structure if you divide
it as shown in <a href="#fig12">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<p>Plywood and untempered hardboard should be sealed
with a primer coat before finish painting. If you seal the
reverse side of the panels also, they warp less. For
finish coats, the enamel now available in aerosol spray
cans will save you some brush work. Always apply spray
paints in several light coats while the surface is horizontal,
to avoid unsightly &ldquo;runs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For bracing, framing, and other woodwork, white pine is
strong, light, easy to work, and unlikely to warp if seasoned
properly.</p>
<p>Hinges, washers, bolts, nails, or screws which will be
painted may be of uncoated steel. Otherwise, you may find
brass, stainless steel, aluminum, or chrome-plated steel
better.</p>
<p>If your exhibit proves to be a winner, you may need to
erect and dismantle it at several fairs. A little ingenuity
and foresight in the selection of removable-pin hinges,
wing-nut bolt assemblies, and the like, may save a lot of
time later and help keep your exhibit structure in good
condition.</p>

<p><i>Lighting and Wiring.</i> Fluorescent lighting is bulky and
hard to conceal in the average science fair exhibit. Incandescent
showcase lamps work well, take up less space, and
are less expensive. If you need shielded light, consider
inexpensive clip-on bed lamps.</p>
<p>Most fairs have rigid rules on electrical wiring and you
should study them and those of the National Science Fair-International.
If you will install a fused entry-outlet box
on your back wall or base unit, as shown in <a href="#fig12">Figure 3</a>, you
can run all fixture cords to that one location. Most fairs
provide power cords reaching to the exhibitor&rsquo;s electrical
inlet, but don&rsquo;t depend on it. Procure 25 to 50 feet of heavy-duty
extension cord and keep it handy, just in case.</p>
<h4>PRESENTING INFORMATION</h4>
<p>After determining the shape and size of your structure,
you can decide how best to present the information needed
to explain your project. Some exhibitors prefer to build
their structure first, so that they may try out different
arrangements of illustrations and three-dimensional items
on the finished display space. Or, you can measure off your
back wall, side walls, and interior base areas, and then
&ldquo;try out&rdquo; the size and placement of your display items on
matching-size sheets of tracing paper.</p>
<p>There are many good ways to present the same information.
Exhibit design is an art with some established
principles but with few fixed rules. Here are some guidelines
which may help you.</p>
<p><i>Preliminary Sketches.</i> Make sketches of all possible
layout ideas and study each for clarity of content and
visual effect.</p>
<p><i>Text.</i> Keep all text to a minimum number of words.
Viewers come to see an exhibit, not to read it! A good illustration,
specimen, or a graphic representation (see
<a href="#fig13">Figure 4</a>) can save many words. Where text is needed,
letter it clearly and large enough for easy reading. But
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
avoid unnecessarily large or garish lettering&mdash;titles and
text should only explain your exhibit, never dominate it!</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="844" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 4</span></p>
</div>
<p><i>Text Placement.</i> Some exhibitors place captions uniformly
over or under all illustrations, but text blocks
placed at the side may communicate as clearly, and help
prevent visual monotony (see <a href="#fig14">Figure 5</a>).</p>
<p><i>Points of Emphasis.</i> If you use a series of illustrations
or specimens to tell a running story, consider enlarging or
featuring one of the most significant items so it can serve
as the focal point of the series, as in <a href="#fig14">Figure 5</a>.</p>
<p><i>Large Photos.</i> Unless your photographs can be viewed in
detail without stooping and squinting, either have them enlarged
or discard them.</p>
<p><i>Color Photos.</i> Color photos are expensive, but just one or
two will add interest to a large group of black-and-white
prints.</p>
<p><i>Charts and Graphs.</i> If your exhibit contains charts and
graphs, keep them simple. Avoid line charts if several
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
curves must cross and recross. Logarithmic charts, scatter
diagrams, and similar ratio charts are confusing to the
average viewer. Caption and explain charts and graphs
adequately. Simple pie, bar, and representational charts, as
shown in <a href="#fig15">Figure 6</a>, can be particularly meaningful. Often
the use of colors will make the various factors more
discernible.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="661" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 5</span></p>
</div>
<p><i>White Space.</i> Next to content, the exhibitor&rsquo;s most valuable
tool is &ldquo;white space&rdquo;&mdash;those unoccupied areas of his
display panels. Crowded, busy panels on which materials
and text fill every inch of space are a hallmark of the
amateur. Worse, they defeat their purpose, for viewers
usually take one hurried glance, decide that understanding
so cluttered an exhibit would be a chore, and move on to
simpler displays. (As a rule of thumb, approximately 40%
of your available display space should be occupied by
absolutely nothing!)</p>
<p><i>Organization.</i> Just as you organize words into sentences
and paragraphs, your exhibit elements (textual and visual)
should be organized into groups and subgroups. (See Figures
<a href="#fig10">1</a> and <a href="#fig11">2</a>.) Here again the &ldquo;feature&rdquo; technique may be employed.
For example, if you are displaying several similar
specimens you may emphasize the most unusual one by
placing it on a raised or differently-colored background as
shown in <a href="#fig16">Figure 7</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" alt="" width="692" height="1000" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 6</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="427" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 7</span></p>
</div>
<p><i>Apparatus.</i> Amateur exhibitors sometimes get carried
away with enthusiasm for large arrays of mechanical apparatus
which are both unnecessary and confusing. If your
project involved development of a unique piece of equipment,
consider whether you can display it alone, without
the entire assembly into which it fits. Sometimes this can
be done by displaying the featured part alongside a drawing
or photograph of the complete assembly, as in <a href="#fig13">Figure 4</a>.
Again, keep details to a minimum; leave them in the project
report.</p>
<p><i>Mechanical movement.</i> Usually motion in a science fair
exhibit is called for only when there is a clear need for it.
Thus it is logical to use a turntable to revolve different
fluorescing mineral specimens under &ldquo;black light&rdquo;, or to
present successive radioactive ore specimens to a Geiger-counter
probe. But to use such a turntable to present a
series of photographs would probably be unnecessarily
contrived. Usually you may spend your efforts better on
sound content, clean design, and clear text than on mechanical
gimmicks.</p>
<p><i>Pushbuttons and Such.</i> Few audience-participation devices
in science fair exhibits merit the effort, money, and
space expended on them. But if you do display equipment
for viewers to operate, make certain it can be operated
safely and dependably even when you are absent (as during
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the judging). Nothing frustrates an exhibit viewer more
than a pushbutton that doesn&rsquo;t work!</p>
<p><i>Demonstrations.</i> These can be informative and interesting,
and you may want to include one. But since you cannot
be on hand to demonstrate at all times, design your
exhibit to &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; without the demonstration. And
when you are absent, you may avoid unsatisfied viewer
curiosity either by removing the idle demonstration equipment,
or by posting a &ldquo;Next demonstration at ____ o&rsquo;clock&rdquo;
sign.</p>
<p><i>Living Things.</i> Plants or animals which have been employed
in the science project can often be displayed to lend
interest and meaning to the exhibit. But since the science
fair follows the project, interim growth and aging may alter
living specimens so that at fair time they are considerably
less meaningful or attractive than at the peak of your
project. Also, if you compete in several fairs, you may find
transportation and special care of your living specimens
difficult and onerous. If you do plan to exhibit living specimens,
familiarize yourself with local and national fair regulations
governing their use, make sure that animals can
be housed attractively and comfortably, and protect both
animals and plants from inquisitive fingers. Then be selective
and employ the minimum needed to make your point
in the exhibit.</p>
<h3 id="c13">About Color</h3>
<p>Properly employed, color is functional as well as aesthetically
pleasing. You may find the following suggestions
helpful in deciding which colors to employ in your exhibit,
and where.</p>
<p>In a space as small as your science fair exhibit, one or
two basic colors, plus black and white, should suffice. Use
your color in a few large blocks, not in many small patches.
Different basic colors can be used to define different main
areas of emphasis; then different shades of the basic colors
can be used to define subareas.</p>
<p>Life-science project exhibits can rely most safely on
pastel shades running heavily to greens and yellows, while
physical-science projects are portrayed frequently against
more intense colors. In either case, avoid violent contrasts
and &ldquo;paintpot&rdquo; variety. Your exhibit should convey an air of
handsome restraint, not flippant prettiness or carnival
gaudiness. Your colors should attract and enhance, not
shock or confuse!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>

<p class="pcapc"><i>Far too frequently science fair judges are asked to evaluate very

can you identify? (Answers below.)</i></p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Answers: Structure extends too high and too low for easy viewing,
and width exceeds dimensions usually allowed. The main title is too
long. Two words are misspelled. The best display space is wasted
on ordinary objects which contribute little new understanding to
topic exhibited. There are too many photographs which are too
small and poorly positioned for viewing. Specimen boxes positioned
on the floor as an afterthought where few viewers will attempt to
inspect them. Endless text provides details of little or no interest
to the average viewer. More text on introductory topic (&ldquo;Catching
Bugs&rdquo;) than on the exhibit topic. No logical progression from the
original problem and hypothesis through experimentation and observation
to conclusions. There is no project notebook, report, or
handout brochure. No thought has been given to lighting. No points
of emphasis in either text or illustrations. White space has not
been exploited.</i></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Where desired, visibility and impact of illustrations and
specimens can be increased by mounting them against contrasting
background colors. Avoid the amateurish impulse
to always tape or paint a border around illustrations,
specimens, and blocks of type. Placed properly against a
contrasting background, these provide their own best border.</p>
<p>The final test of color is how it looks in actual use, so
experiment with your color schemes before making a final
choice. And if you have any doubts, invite the reactions of
your family and friends and also the advice of your art
teacher.</p>
<h3 id="c14">Completing Your Exhibit</h3>
<p>Before mounting your exhibit elements on the structure
permanently, lay them out temporarily. (You will probably
want to move them around several times to get the best
position.) You can then pencil in your title, text, and caption
blocks in actual size. Use separate sheets of paper for each,
and try out various locations around the materials they
explain.</p>
<p>Use of too many letter styles will detract from the attractiveness
of your exhibit. Headings can be all in capital
letters, and subheads in smaller &ldquo;caps&rdquo;, or in initial caps
and &ldquo;lower case&rdquo; letters. Statements and other text should
use caps and lower case. Do not use all caps for a paragraph
of descriptive material&mdash;a mass of capitals is harder to
read.</p>
<p>Before completing the lettering, you should try out your
layout and text on classmates, family, and perhaps your
English teacher. Science fair exhibits should be understandable
to intelligent laymen as well as to trained specialists.
Technical jargon, pompous adjectives, and stilted
sentence structure are not scientific. In scientific writing,
as in any good writing, the simple, direct approach is usually
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
best. Try to use short sentences, familiar words, and a
minimum of technical terms and formulae.</p>
<p>Are your present photographs too small? You can experiment
with desirable sizes of photos by clipping from old
magazines any illustrations that appear about the right size,
and trying them on your layout. You can then have your
photos enlarged to the ideal sizes that you find most pleasing.
Matte-finish photo prints are preferable since glossy
prints produce &ldquo;glare&rdquo;. Before mounting photographs, trim
off the white border, which detracts from the impact of
your pictures and the simple unity of your exhibit.</p>
<p>When fully satisfied with your layout, begin the final
lettering of your text. For hand-lettering, sketch with a soft
pencil first, using a ruler and eraser freely. A lettering
guide, borrowed from your school&rsquo;s graphic arts department,
will prove very helpful. Unless you are experienced
you can save yourself trouble by not lettering directly upon
the background. Instead, letter each copy block on a separate
piece of art paper which can be glued into position later.
Have a friend or teacher double-check your lettering for
typographical errors.</p>
<p>With illustrations and copy blocks complete and trimmed
to size, you are ready to start mounting. For paper products
use &ldquo;rubber cement&rdquo;, obtainable at stationery stores. Coat
both surfaces completely, but do not press them together
until each is dry. To avoid air bubbles, first separate the
coated surfaces with a &ldquo;slip sheet&rdquo; of waxed paper or aluminum
foil, which can be slipped out when the materials
are positioned exactly. Then press into place with a soft
cloth or rubber roller. (Excess cement will rub off when
dry, without damage.) Also consider using double-coated
adhesive tape for mounting. It is obtainable at art-supply
stores.</p>
<p>Assemble your structure, mount your lighting fixtures,
and plug them in. Install whatever equipment needs to be
displayed. Put your project notebook, project report, and
handout brochure in place. Your science fair exhibit is
finished and you are ready to compete!</p>

<p>Some of you can look forward to enjoying within the next
several years a thrilling experience.</p>
<p>Some morning in May you will bid your parents farewell,
walk up the steps of an airliner, and touch down a few hours
later in a distant city. For the next five days you will be
caught up in the excitement and fascination of the National
Science Fair-International!</p>
<p>The full impact of your nation&rsquo;s science fair hits you the
morning you set up your exhibit in the auditorium. You knew
that you had a good exhibit when you entered the district
fair back home in March. (Since this is your second year of
serious competition, and you have improved both your science
project and your exhibit, you weren&rsquo;t too surprised to
win there.) But regional and statewide competition is even
tougher, so you were holding your breath until they finally
called your name!</p>
<p>Now here you are, and as you appraise the 400 other exhibits
going up besides yours, you realize this is the &ldquo;big
league&rdquo;. These guys and gals are really good. But some of
your awe evaporates as you talk with your neighbors, and
while you help the pretty blonde with the guppies position
her heavy aquaria. Win or not, this is going to be fun!</p>
<p>And so it is&mdash;during the tension of the judging the next
day, when you show your exhibit to the public the day after
that, and throughout the tours of research laboratories and
industrial processing plants that follow. In conversations
with the judges, in the varied social contacts with more than
400 fellow exhibitors from the United States and several
foreign countries, you get a fresh look at the rewards of
serious scientific endeavor. One evening you listen enthralled
by the startling concept being explained by one of
the &ldquo;big men&rdquo; in science. You&rsquo;ve seen his name and picture
in newspapers, textbooks, and technical journals, and there
he stands, talking seriously to you and your fellow exhibitors.
As he explains a problem that has puzzled you,
you begin to see science as a community of kindred minds
where every serious truth-seeker is welcome, where there
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
is no rank other than that bestowed on active intellects,
sound procedures, and reasoned, honest conclusions.</p>
<p>All too soon, the week is almost over. At the Awards
Banquet they are calling the names of the winners and you
sit unsurprised when the early prizes pass you by. You&rsquo;ve
studied those winning exhibits, and you must acknowledge
that they have the edge on yours&mdash;one because of the very
unusual hypothesis posed and proved, the other because of
the masterful clarity with which it explains the area of
investigation.</p>
<p>But next they name the winners of special awards,
presented by the American Chemical Society, The American
Institute of Biological Sciences, the military departments,
and similar organizations, for outstanding exhibits related
to the programs of the sponsors. And here you are on the
stage, having your photograph taken with the nine other
winners of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission&rsquo;s Special

<p>After the banquet, the AEC representative explains to you
that the AEC Special Award includes considerably more than
the Certificate of Achievement you have just received.</p>
<p>First, a duplicate certificate will be sent to your principal
for display among the school trophies. Then, in August you
and your science teacher will fly to Chicago for a week as
exciting and rewarding as the one you have just completed.
You will be guests of the AEC&rsquo;s Argonne National Laboratory&mdash;an
outstanding center for nuclear research. Your
group will spend several days behind the scenes in Argonne&rsquo;s
laboratories. You will visit outstanding research
facilities and science museums in downtown Chicago. Best
of all, you will have an opportunity to discuss your interests
and career plans with members of the Argonne staff&mdash;men
and women who are doing professional research in the same
areas that interest you.</p>
<p>What are the costs of such an experience? Only the attention
you pay to your science instruction; the thought and
care you devote to a project related to nuclear science; and
the clarity and ingenuity with which you explain that
project to your classmates, teachers, and the general
public through your science fair exhibit.</p>

<p>Or &ldquo;where do you go from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>First, resolve now to enter science fair competition this
year. You may not win, but at least you will have started,
and you will gain some of the experience needed for victory
in later years.</p>
<p>Next, choose a science project topic, and discuss your
choice with your science teacher, science club adviser, or
hobby counselor. Especially if this is your first attempt,
choose a topic which can be investigated with materials
and equipment available to you at school or at home, and
which can be finished by mid-February. Also, allocate definite
times&mdash;particularly on weekends and holidays&mdash;when
you will work on your project. (Remember that exams and
term papers will probably keep you very busy in late
January and early February.)</p>
<p>Third, execute your project, keeping careful notes and
consulting your project counselor from time to time. Then
draft your Project Report, discuss it with your counselor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
revise and edit it as necessary, and get it typed in final
form. Also verify the date your local science fair opens.</p>
<p>Fourth, plan your exhibit content, design and build your
exhibit structure, select your exhibit components and draft
your text, and make trial layouts until you arrive at the
best possible design, including color. Prepare your color
backgrounds, letter your text, and install text, components,
and lighting. Get your handout brochure mimeographed.</p>
<p>Fifth, enter local science fair competition. If you don&rsquo;t
win, find out why by comparing your project and your exhibit
with the winners&rsquo;, and by discussing it with your
parents, classmates, teachers, judges, and viewers. If you
do win, attempt to understand what made your exhibit
better than the others.</p>
<p>Finally, continue reading and thinking about your basic
project topic, so that next year you will know whether you
want to continue to work on the same topic or to shift your
interest to another field.</p>
<p>Above all, have fun, and</p>
<p class="tbcenter">GOOD LUCK!</p>

<br />WORKING WITH RADIATION AND RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS</h2>
<p>No scientist worth his title ever exposes himself needlessly
to any potential hazards which confront him in his
investigations. Thoughtful student scientists also will avoid
any unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation, particularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
since bad habits acquired while doing student projects may
be difficult to overcome later.</p>
<p>Before undertaking experiments with radioactivity, consult
your science teacher or project counselor. Any materials
to be irradiated should be processed with professional
equipment by persons trained and authorized to
operate it. Use of radioisotopes, even in quantities exempt
from license requirements, usually involves special laboratory
facilities, techniques, and instruments, as well as
the isotope itself. Make certain that all these will be
available to you before you embark on your project.</p>
<p>If possible, conduct all work with radioisotopes under the
supervision of a trained, experienced isotope technician.
At the very least, familiarize yourself with the specialized
handling techniques required (see <i>Experiments with Radioactivity</i>
or <i>Laboratory Experiments with Radioisotopes
for High School Science Demonstrations</i>, listed in <a href="#c19">Appendix III</a>).
Then follow them to the letter!</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">APPENDIX V</span>

<br />INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE FAIR RULES</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Finalists who enter the ISF must follow these rules without exception.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following code refers to the ISF rules listed below:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">S&mdash;School Fairs (recommended)</p>
<p class="t0">R&mdash;Regional Fairs (recommended)</p>
<p class="t0">I&mdash;ISF (required)</p>
</div>
<h3>S-R-I</h3>
<p>Categories established for grouping and judging science projects
at the ISF are:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Botany</p>
<p class="t0">Zoology</p>
<p class="t0">Medicine and Health</p>
<p class="t0">Biochemistry</p>
<p class="t0">Chemistry</p>
<p class="t0">Pure Physics</p>
<p class="t0">Applied Physics and Engineering</p>
<p class="t0">Mathematics and Computers</p>
<p class="t0">Earth and Space Sciences</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Entries in any of these categories, if nuclear-related, will be
considered for AEC Special Awards at the International Science
Fair.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>S-R-I</h3>
<p>Project exhibit size is limited to 30 inches deep (front to back),
48 inches wide (side to side), and 12 feet high (floor to top). Any
project exceeding these dimensions is oversize and does not
qualify for entrance in the ISF.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h3>R-I</h3>
<p>Each exhibitor must assemble his or her exhibit without major
outside help, except for transportation and unpacking.</p>
<h3>S-R-I</h3>
<p>A typed abstract of the project, using not more than 250 words,
is required and must be displayed with the project.</p>
<h3>S-R-I</h3>
<p>Anything which could be hazardous to public display is prohibited.
This includes:</p>
<p>Live poisonous animals may not be displayed.</p>
<p>No dangerous chemical substances such as caustics, acids,
highly combustible solids, fluids or gases may be displayed. If
such materials are required, inert substitutes should be used.</p>
<p>No open flames are permitted.</p>
<p>Any project producing temperatures exceeding 100&deg;C must be
adequately insulated from its surroundings.</p>
<p>Highly flammable display materials are prohibited.</p>
<p>Tanks which have contained combustible gases must be purged
with carbon dioxide. No combustible fuel may be displayed.</p>
<p>High voltage equipment such as large vacuum tubes or dangerous
ray-generating devices must be shielded and safety checked by a
qualified inspector. Students should be cautioned in advance about
the dangers of experimenting with such equipment and their work
carefully supervised.</p>
<h3>S-R-I</h3>
<p>No live, warm-blooded animals may be displayed at the ISF.
Projects involving the use of such animals may display photographs,
drawings, charts or graphs to illustrate the conditions,
developments, and results of the investigations. This eliminates
the needless shipping, housing, care, harm, discomfort or loss of
animals.</p>
<h3>S-R-I</h3>
<p>During judging the exhibit area is closed to all except judges and
authorized personnel. Exhibitors may be present only at a specified
time during which they are to remain at their exhibits.</p>
<h3>S-R-I</h3>
<p>All exhibitors must be interviewed at their projects by at least
one judge. The purpose of all interviews is to determine the exhibitors&rsquo;
familiarity with the project, the science involved, and to
give the student an opportunity to meet the judges, react to questions
and to discuss their work with a recognized leader. Care
must be taken to allow a reasonable interview time within the time
limits allotted for judging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Not more than two students, male or female, may be certified
as finalists to the ISF from an affiliated science fair. They must
be students in 10th, 11th or 12th year classes in a public, private
or parochial school.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>A student who will have reached age 21 on or before May 1, preceding
the ISF is not eligible to participate as a finalist in the ISF.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>A student may enter only one project and it must be his own
work. Group projects involving two or more students give experience
to beginners and are acceptable in S or R fairs but may not
be entered in the ISF.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>The identical repetition of previous year&rsquo;s project is not permitted.
However, a student may again exhibit work on a continuing
problem provided the work demonstrates considerable progress
when compared with the previous year.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Finalists must be accompanied to the ISF by an official adult
escort designated and/or sponsored by the regional fair. Responsibility
and liability for entry in the ISF rests with the affiliated
fair organization which finances the entry, provides transportation
for the finalists and their projects, and living expenses during
ISF.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Students planning to enter exhibits in the ISF which contain materials
that may be regulated by a quarantine should first consult
with a Federal or State plant pest control or animal health inspector,
a county agricultural agent, or write to the Director, Plant
Pest Control Division, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Federal
Center Building, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782.</p>
<h3>S-R-I Regulations for Experiments With Animals</h3>
<p><i>This guide was prepared and approved by the National Society
for Medical Research, the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources
(National Research Council), and the American Association
for Laboratory Animal Science (1968).</i></p>
<p>1. The basic aims of scientific studies involving animals are to
achieve an understanding of life and to advance our knowledge of
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
life processes. Such studies lead to respect for life.</p>
<p>2. Insects, other invertebrates and protozoa are materials of
choice for many experiments. They offer opportunities for exploration
of biological principles and extension of established ones.
Their wide variety and the feasibility of using larger numbers than
is usually possible with vertebrates makes them especially suitable
for illustrating principles.</p>
<p>3. A qualified adult supervisor must assume primary responsibility
for the purposes and conditions of any experiment that involves
living animals.</p>
<p>4. No experiment should be undertaken that involves anesthetic
drugs, surgical procedures, pathogenic organisms, toxicological
products, carcinogens, or ionizing radiation unless a trained life
scientist, physician, dentist or veterinarian directly supervises the
experiment.</p>
<p>5. Any experiment must be performed with the animal under
appropriate anesthesia if pain is involved.</p>
<p>6. The comfort of the animal used in any study shall be a prime
concern of the student investigator. Gentle handling, proper feeding,
and provision of appropriate sanitary quarters shall be strictly
observed. Any experiment in nutritional deficiency may proceed
only to the point where symptoms of the deficiency appear. Appropriate
measures shall then be taken to correct the deficiency,
if such action is feasible, the animal(s) shall be killed by a humane
method.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
